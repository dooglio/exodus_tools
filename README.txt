This respository is my personal collection of various simple, portable scripts and tools for crypto-wallets, key manipulations, etc.

BIP39: This tool is from https://github.com/iancoleman/bip39 full credit to iancoleman for making this fantastic tool! Should be downloaded and used offline for security. Supports the generation of, and derivation from, mnemonic seeds for many different crypto-currencies. 

verifyLinux.sh: A linux shell script to automatically verify a downloaded Exodus wallet. The script assumes your download is in your ~/Downloads folder. All you need is curl, gnupg CLI tools, and the URL to the newest release hashes, available from https://www.exodus.io/releases/
